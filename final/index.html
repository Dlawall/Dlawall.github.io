  <h1><span><strong>With the help of data and strict policies, the University of Maryland traverses deadly pandemic</strong></span></h1>
<p><i>By: Daniel Lawall</i></p>
<p class="date">May 6, 2021</p>
<p>As the University of Maryland’s spring semester began in late January, students, staff, and family members all wondered the same question: how will the tens of thousands of on campus students, educators and administrators last another semester in the midst of the global COVID-19 pandemic?</p> 
<p>A semester that got out of hand, that led to more long-term shutdowns of on campus facilities and increased isolation would have devastated the 20-somethings that left their homes in hope of living out the next chapter of their lives.</p>
<p> For UMD, the answer to curtailing the spread of the virus was a stringent testing regimen and ambitious vaccination rollout, one that required a strong commitment to adherence from on-campus students and a willingness to crack down from the University. 
The University’s COVID-19 dashboard, tracked all pertinent data from the onset of the pandemic, providing context to a complex outbreak in real time for those living on campus.</p>
  <h2><span>AUGUST 27, 2020</span></h2>
<p>Testing ramped up in the final week of August as students moved back to campus after summer break. </p>
<p>“All students who are physically returning to campus or the College Park area must have a pre-arrival and post-arrival COVID-19 test,” University Darryll Pines said in a pre-semester announcement to students, faculty and staff.</p>
<p>Pines, administrators, and the University as a whole were not available for comment.</p>

<p>UMD boasts its concise 4Maryland campaign against the virus, which focuses on mask wearing, hand washing, social distancing, and isolation in the event an individual feels sick, according to the University’s website. </p>
<p>But compliance with guidelines slipped, however, and the University braced for its first major spike in positive cases.</p>
  <h2><span>SEPTEMBER 9, 2020</span></h2>
<p>In the span of two weeks, the University was in the midst of its heaviest positive-case spell, averaging 41.9 positive tests between on campus testing measures and self reported positives from off-campus students and staff. </p>
<p>On September 10, UMD resumed a small portion of its in person learning procedure for undergraduate students (graduate classes were allowed to continue in their already limited capacity). This change to the online learning environment came despite university residents averaging 20 positive cases per day until October 5.</p>

<p>Average daily positives never rose above eleven cases per day for the remainder of the semester, per COVID-19 dashboard findings.</p> 
  <h2><span>JANUARY 25, 2021</span></h2>
<p>As students returned from holiday break to begin the spring semester, the University braced for another spike in cases. 
By the third week of classes, students, faculty and staff were already averaging over 20 positive cases per day. The fourth week of classes would bring University function to a grinding halt. </p>
<p>“Earlier this week, we notified you of a rise in COVID-19 cases in our community and took measures to mitigate viral spread. Since then, we have experienced a further increase in such cases,” President Pines, along with Health Center Director Spyridon S. Marinopolos said in a letter to all University residents.</p>
<p> The school implemented a mandatory sequester in place, shutting down all in person undergraduate learning environments, and only allowing dining areas to be open for pick-up meals. Students were expected to stay in their rooms and limit their contact with others. </p>

<p>“[It] definitely made it hard to meet people and find stuff to do,” freshman and North Campus resident Ethan Bitar said. “Things like having to take food back to my room to eat alone and always wearing masks made it tough for a new student like me.”</p>
<p>February’s surge peaked at 67 positive cases on February 21, closing out a more severe but significantly more abbreviated surge when compared to the rise in cases in the fall.</p>
<p>Cases eventually began to taper off. After a brief resurgence after spring break, the University now averages one positive case per day. </p>
<p>“Overall, the University did a great job containing the virus,” freshman Will Yang said. “At first in the fall, I was afraid that we would get sent home [like other schools]. Cases never got too out of hand.”</p>

<p>Yang, like many freshman, endured a grueling beginning to their second semester of college, but was able to find solace in the University’s ability to lock down outbreaks and continue to push into the summer months. </p>
<p>“[As the semester progressed], we got more freedom, like having guests over, dining in the dining halls, etc.,” Yang said. “They were very effective in keeping the virus out and being strict about the rules.”</p>
