<p>As the University of Marylandâ€™s spring semester began in late January, students, staff, and family members all wondered the same question: how will the tens of thousands of on campus students, educators and administrators last another semester in the midst of the global COVID-19 pandemic?</p>

  <p>So many students were already grappling with the adjustment to online schooling. Some lost family members. Others struggled with not being able to visit friends and relatives, locked in their rooms over holiday breaks and anxiety filled mid-semester trips home.</p> 
<p>A semester that got out of hand, that led to more long-term shutdowns of on campus facilities and increased isolation would have devastated the 20-somethings that left their homes in hope of living out the next chapter of their lives.</p>
  <p>For UMD, the answer to curtailing the spread of the virus was a stringent testing regimen and ambitious vaccination rollout, one that required a strong commitment to adherence from on-campus students and a willingness to crack down from the University. 
  UMD opened up its testing system last summer, before the start of the fall semester in late August 2020. In conjunction with their on campus testing efforts, the University also launched its COVID-19 dashboard, a comprehensive tool that combines gross totals and rates of change in tests taken and overall positivity. </p>
 <p> Insert quote or message from admin/Pines here </p>
  <p>For the spring semester, the school was very clear on its expectations for on-campus students; if you live in a University owned housing complex of any kind, you were required to be tested at least every two weeks. If a student were to not comply with University mandates, they would receive a restriction to their privileges on campus.</p>
